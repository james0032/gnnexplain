## 📚 State-of-the-Art Methods (from Literature)

### **3. GNNExplainer** (2019) - Classic Baseline
**Paper**: [NeurIPS 2019](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/gnnexplainer-neurips19.pdf)
**Implementation**: PyTorch Geometric `torch_geometric.explain.GNNExplainer`

**Method**:
- Learns soft masks on edges and node features
- Maximizes mutual information (MI) between masked graph and prediction
- Optimization-based approach

**Technical Details**:
```python
# Objective
max MI(Y, (G_S, X_S)) = H(Y) - H(Y | G = G_S, X = X_S)

# Where:
# G_S = masked graph structure
# X_S = masked node features
# Y = model prediction
```

**Complexity**: O(|Ec| × T) where Ec = candidate edges, T = optimization steps

**Pros**:
- ✅ Model-agnostic (works with any GNN)
- ✅ Theoretically grounded (MI maximization)
- ✅ Available in PyTorch Geometric

**Cons**:
- ❌ Requires optimization per instance (slow)
- ❌ May not generate connected subgraphs
- ❌ Edge masks can be continuous (not discrete)

**Link Prediction Performance**: Moderate (designed for node classification originally)

**Compatibility with RGCNDistMultModel**: ⚠️ Needs wrapper (see note below)

```python
# Train a mask predictor
mask_predictor: Graph → Edge_Masks

# Training: Maximize MI over training distribution
# Inference: Single forward pass (very fast)

**Technical Details**:
```python
# Shapley value for subgraph S
φ(S) = Σ [|S'|!(|V|-|S'|-1)!/|V|!] × [f(S' ∪ S) - f(S')]

# MCTS explores subgraph space efficiently
```

## 🔧 Integration Notes

### Adapting PyG Explainers to RGCN-DistMult

**Challenge**: PyG explainers expect node-level predictions, but link prediction is edge-level.

**Solution**: Create a wrapper that converts link prediction to node embedding task:

```python
class LinkPredictionWrapper(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, rgcn_distmult_model, target_triple):
        super().__init__()
        self.model = rgcn_distmult_model
        self.target_head = target_triple[0]
        self.target_tail = target_triple[2]
        self.target_rel = target_triple[1]

    def forward(self, x, edge_index, edge_attr=None):
        # Encode nodes
        node_emb = self.model.encode(edge_index, edge_attr)

        # Decode specific triple
        head_emb = node_emb[self.target_head:self.target_head+1]
        tail_emb = node_emb[self.target_tail:self.target_tail+1]
        rel_idx = torch.tensor([self.target_rel], device=x.device)

        score = self.model.decoder(head_emb, tail_emb, rel_idx)
        return score

# Then use with any PyG explainer
explainer = Explainer(
    model=wrapper,
    algorithm=PGExplainer(...),
    ...
)
```
